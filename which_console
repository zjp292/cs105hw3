Which gaming console do you prefer?
I personally game on pc but have a switch for the great nintendo games and re-releases like Super Mario Sunshine

I have used both xbox and ps4 and don't have much of a preference, growing up I had both the ps1/2, and the original xbox (it still works!)
I also using PC from some games like League of Legends.
