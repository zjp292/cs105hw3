Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind is a pretty good movie, but its kinda werid seeing Jim Carrey be serious and sad

If you haven't seen mother!, starring Jennifer Lawrence I would say you definitely should! It's on Hulu, and is hugely metaphorical  !!(Spoilers Ahead)!! It is a metaphor about climate change and how badly humans are messing up the world.

Clockwork Orange is a briliant film by Kubrick based off of a novel.
