So I got water on my laptop last week and only the screen was damaged (thankfully), so we took it to the apple store to be fixed last Saturday.
They told it was going to be $600, just for the screen. Obviously that's not cheap so I was worried about it. My mom picks it up, (the apple store is in Phoenix).
They fixed it FOR FREE!!! They also replaced my charger which got water damaged too for free! We didn't ask why it was free, but who cares at this point.


I have been using the rental laptop from Cline library this week and I have to turn it in tonight so I'm trying to finish the group work asap lol.

I have a feeling the library is gonna be really quiet and spooky and night, so that won't be fun.
