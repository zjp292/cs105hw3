I feel like I haven't gotten to play much video games since I got to college.
I started replaying God of War before I left, and I really want to finish the games because I got cut off halfway through!

I also feel the same.
I have been replaying Red Dead Redemption 2 and trying to 100 percent it in my free time :)
